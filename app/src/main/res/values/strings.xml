Welcome!

In this app I'll talk about Computer Science and coding - a field that has existed only quite recently
and even more recent getting well known and popular.

This is only a basic covering about the topic, but the goal is to spark interest getting to know the field more!

"In here I\'ll cover a little about basic programming concepts.

I will talk about the idea of Data Types and Variables, If Statements, and Loops.

Each topic has a dedicated button you can click on to go to.

There, you will be taught, and tested about the concept you've learned about.

Give it a go!"

        "So, what are Variables?"
        "Variables are used to store information, which can be about anything!\n\n"

        "Storing information serves us for many stuff, such as helping us do logic we want to do, depending on the value of the variable\n"
        "they have a name, an \"ID\" of sorts, which lets the programmer tell apart from one variable to another.\n"

        "Typically, we define variables like this:"
        "var variableName: Type = value\n\n"

        "We need to highlight to the computer that we are creating a new \'ID\', and we do that with the [var] keyword.\n\n"

        "There are different types of variables - there are those that store numbers, those that can store text, and so on. We tell the type to the computer so it can"
        "differentiate between the different types, and we\'ll write the name in place of [Type]\n\n"

        "There are many types, but we will only mention some\n"

        "[value] is where we assign the variable with the information. Note that we can change the value the variable holds later on! as we wish!\n\n\n"

        "Examples:\n"
        "var numberOfApples: int = 4\n"
        "var priceForASoda: double = 15.6\n"
        "var nameOfAuthor: String = \"Stephen King\"\n\n"

        "In the first example, we've created a variable that can hold integers, and put into it the value 4, in the second example, we created a variable that holds"
        "a decimal number and its value is 15.6, and finally, in the third example, the variable holds a sentence, and its value is \"Stephen King\"."
    </string>

    <string name="lesson_if_else_explanation">
    "Let’s talk about something very important in programming - logic!\n"
    "We can make decisions in our code by using [if] statements.\n\n"

    "[if] allows us to ask a question, and if the answer is true - we do something!\n"
    "We can also use [else] to do something different, if the answer is false.\n\n"

    "The structure looks like this:"
    "if (condition) {\n"
    "    // do something\n"
    "} else {\n"
    "    // do something else\n"
    "}\n\n"

    "The [condition] is something that results in either true or false.\n"
    "For example: [if (score > 10)] checks if the score is greater than 10.\n"

    "If that’s true, we enter the first block. If it’s false, we go to the [else] block.\n\n"

    "Example:\n"
    "if (age >= 18) {\n"
    "    println(\"You can enter\")\n"
    "} else {\n"
    "    println(\"You cannot enter\")\n"
    "}\n\n"

    "This checks if the age is at least 18. If it is, we have something that can print to the screen that the person can enter."
    </string>

    <string name="lesson_for_loop_explanation">
    "What if we want to repeat something many times?\n"
    "That’s where \'for loops\' come in!\n\n"

    "for loops allow us to run code again and again, in a structured way.\n"
    "Usually, we repeat over a range of numbers, or over items in a list.\n\n"

    "The structure is simple:"
    "for (item in something) {\n"
    "    // do something\n"
    "}\n\n"

    "We’ll often use [0 until N] to count:\n"
    "for (i in 0 until 5) {\n"
    "    println(i)\n"
    "}\n\n"

    "This loop will print the numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n"
    "It repeats the block 5 times — once for each number in that range.\n\n"

    "We can use this to do many things: move characters, calculate sums, or run logic multiple times!"
